# Yellow Pages Restaurant Scraper

## How to run:
- download files
- locate `scraper_v2.py`
- run that file

## Outputs
- the script will output 2 files: `pre_cleaned_output.csv` and `cleaned.csv`
- pretty clear what means what
- the ones I have here are simply samples and yours will be much longer as I only went through the first 3 pages here out of 100 total
